The makefile begins with `main: main.c`.
This is saying that main is what I want to build, and main.c is required to build main

Next, I use the -Wall flag. This stands for all warnings, and allows for additional warnings from the compiler.

Next, I used the -Wextra and -pedantic flags. These are more warnings

Finally, -std=c99 specifies that the C standard for my code is C99 

After saving the file, I use the `make` command in my terminal to compile the program
